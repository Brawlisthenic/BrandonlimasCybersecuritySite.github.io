											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>From a young age, I have been deeply interested in technology and how its various components function and interact. Upon graduating from high school, I pursued a career in graphic design and earned a DEP in Computer Graphics. However, after working in the field for three years, I felt the need to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone. I explored different fields, including carpentry, but ultimately discovered my passion for cybersecurity while exploring educational opportunities at a local university. I graduated from McGill University with a degree in Cybersecurity and am currently working towards my CompTIA A+ certification.</p>

									<h2>Projects</h2>
									<h3 class="text-5 text-white"><strong>Helpdesk Support project:</strong></h3>   
									<p><strong> 1- Network connectivity problems: </strong>Troubleshot and identified issues with network configuration, DNS settings, and IP addressing. Implemented changes such as updating router firmware and reconfiguring network settings to resolve connectivity issues.

<strong>2- Software issues: </strong>Investigated and identified problems with software installations, updates, and conflicts. Implemented solutions such as reinstalling software, updating drivers, and resolving compatibility issues to fix software problems.

<strong>3- Hardware failures: </strong>Diagnosed and identified hardware failures such as faulty hardware components and power supply issues. Implemented solutions such as replacing faulty components and repairing power supply units to resolve hardware failures.

<strong>4- Training and guidance:</strong> In addition, I provided training and guidance to the users on how to maintain the system, and how to address the common problems that they may face with the system

<strong>5- Monitoring and maintenance system: </strong> I also implemented a monitoring and maintenance system that allowed me to proactively detect and fix problems before they caused major disruptions. </p>


									<h3 class="text-5 text-white"><strong>Network Setup and Configuration project: Network Setup and Configuration</strong></h3>
<p><strong> 1- Designed the small-scale network</strong>by creating a network diagram and determining the specific number and types of devices needed for the network. This included determining the number of routers, switches, and other necessary devices, as well as deciding on the appropriate network protocols and technologies to be used, such as TCP/IP, DNS, and DHCP.

<strong>2- Set up the network </strong> by physically installing the necessary devices, such as routers and switches. This included connecting the devices to each other and to the necessary power and data sources.

<strong>3- Configured the network </strong>by properly setting up the chosen protocols and technologies, such as TCP/IP, DNS, and DHCP. This included configuring IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways for each device, as well as configuring DNS and DHCP settings to ensure proper network communication and device assignment.

<strong>4- Managed network devices</strong> by regularly monitoring the network to identify and troubleshoot any issues that arose. This included monitoring network performance metrics such as bandwidth and latency, as well as troubleshooting any connectivity or device-specific issues that arose. As necessary, made adjustments and updates to the network configuration to improve network uptime and performance. This could include optimizing routing protocols, adjusting firewall settings, and updating device firmware. </p>

<h3 class="text-5 text-white"><strong>IT Asset Management project: IT Asset Management System</strong></h3>
Created and maintained an inventory system for tracking and managing the IT assets of NEXUS TECH, which included gathering and organizing information about hardware and software assets and tracking and reporting on the status of those assets. This led to an organized view of the assets and helped in better management.
